# car-auction-game (discontinued)
In the repository is my work on creating an online car auction game.
This was never written with the intention of actually launching but to learn the react frontend and express backend routing better.
Please feel free to copy any code you seen in here, but be aware that this should not be copied without thought
as there are new version of especially react-router-dom which makes the routing in the frontend very different.
